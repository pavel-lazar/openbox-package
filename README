A SAMPLE PACKAGE
================

    Click supports dynamically linked 'packages' containing extra elements.
This is a package with elements used by the openbox project. 


INSTALLATION
------------

    This section describes how you can install this package -- which is
named 'openbox'. 

    Before you can build a package, you must install Click into some
directory DIR. (You set DIR with the '--prefix=DIR' option to Click's
'./configure'.) We often use '/usr/local/click', but if you do not have
permission on that directory, '$HOME' or '$HOME/click' works just as well.

    Now you must configure your package, telling it where the Click install
directory is. First run the 'autoconf' tool to generate a 'configure' script. 
Then './configure --prefix=DIR', where DIR is the Click install directory. 
The package will be installed in DIR, where the Click drivers can find it. 
(The package './configure' has several interesting options, like 
'--disable-linuxmodule'; run './configure --help' to see them.)

    Next, just run 'make install'. This will build and install element
collections for both drivers, manual pages for the package's elements, and
an 'elementmap' for the package.
